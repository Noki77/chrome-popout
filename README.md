# Chrome pop-out
Chrome extension to pop-out any video element on your current viewed browser tab.
Uses the native pop-out feature of Chrome found in the context menu when right-clicking videos.
Some websites won't allow this context menu entry (or need to open a second context menu) as they are using custom menus or have separate layers above the video element.

This extension makes stuff work easily even on sites like YouTube or Twitch.

## Installation
Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-pop-out/jcgacckndmapfdcccebjlhglchkbfkjk?authuser=2)

## Usage
Just focus the browser tab containing the video and click on the extension icon to the right of your address bar.

## Limitations
The extension currently just uses the first video element available on the site.
This will be fixed in a future version containing a way to choose the particular element.
